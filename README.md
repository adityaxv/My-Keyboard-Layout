# My-Keyboard-Layout
- This layout is a modified version of the Colemak keyboard layout for ANSI keyboards.
- It reduces effort required to type. It also reduces pain that happens if you type for too long. It has way balanced key structure then QWERTY keyboard layout.
- My maximum typing speed from this layout is 116 wpm on MonkeyType after around 6 months.
