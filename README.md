# My-Keyboard-Layout
- This layout is a modified version of the Colemak keyboard layout for ANSI keyboards.
- It reduces effort required to type. It also reduces pain that happens if you type for too long. It has way balanced key structure then QWERTY keyboard layout.
- I reached typing speed of 130 wpm using this layout on MonkeyType in just 1 year. (current 144 wpm)
- You can find my experience and thoughts on this new layout here: https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2954-my-expereince-after-typing-colemakdhk-for-about-10-months/#p25003
